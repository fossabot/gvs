# gvs

go/global/general versioning system


* Dead simple & single binary with tons of features
* AutoSync - Reduces needless Merging and Forking


* Manage commit access to parts of a repo using control lists
* Edit, fold, drop changesets in the style of git rebase --interactive
* Track large binary files
* Send email to subscribed addresses to notify repository changes
* Send a collection of changesets as a series of patch emails
* Purge all files and dirs in the repository that are not being tracked
* Handle nested repositories
* Allow commands to affect multiple repositories simultaneously
* Count lines of source code
* List TODOs


what is different from GIT:

* integrated SSL server.. should be as easy as 
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer
* integrated RBAC
